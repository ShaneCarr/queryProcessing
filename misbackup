You
what is the industry best pracice on how  much reserve capacity you should leave on a write node? Geneally this is post gres 9.6. You never run these at 100%. So you look for a reserve capacity. What does science typically say. I'd like to draw a red line where that is.
Great. so there is failover but it takes time so it's an outage. It's catastropihc because the entire system goes down. can you please drive that line on the image. And note thatsummary, and state some sources?

Industry best practices suggest that for critical systems, especially databases, it's important to maintain a certain level of reserve capacity to handle unexpected spikes in demand and to ensure system stability. The exact amount of reserve capacity can vary based on specific use cases, risk tolerance, and system architecture, but a common rule of thumb is to plan for the system to operate comfortably at 50-70% of total capacity during normal operation. This allows for headroom to absorb unexpected loads and growth without performance degradation.

Here are some points typically highlighted in best practices:

Performance Buffer: Maintain a performance buffer to ensure that the database can handle peak loads without degradation, typically above the average load.
Failover Readiness: In the event of failover, the additional load on remaining systems should not push them beyond 70-80% utilization to avoid performance issues during the recovery period.
Scalability: Design the system with scalability in mind so that capacity can be added without significant downtime or disruption.
Monitoring and Alerts: Implement robust monitoring and set up alerts for when usage approaches the reserved capacity threshold.
Load Testing: Regular load testing to ensure that the system performs well under expected and peak loads.
It's also worth noting that newer versions of PostgreSQL (beyond 9.6) have performance improvements and may handle loads differently, so these guidelines might be adjusted for more modern systems.

Let's go ahead and add a visual indicator for this reserve capacity to the visualization. We can place a red line at the 70% mark to represent the upper limit of recommended usage for the write node.

	1	User Domain scale for User Storyline
Specification – YRFC <insert number>
Author(s): First Surname (first.surname@microsoft.com)
Date: 2023-01-01

1.1	Executive Summary

Microsoft Teams' Storyline feature will be a cornerstone of collaborative experiences within the M365 ecosystem. To support its growth trajectory and the associated scale demand on the user domain, we are initiating a headroom analysis on our user’s domain and considering potential mitigations to scale issue. This is critical to understanding our current infrastructure's capacity to manage the existing 650 million entries—comprising both active and deleted users—and to prepare for an target of integrating up to 935 million licensed users.


1.2	Motivation

•	Scale: Currently handling 650 million entries in the users' table, need to store up to one billion users.
•	Opportunity: There are two ways to capture users. We can sell new licenses, or we can capture existing MAU. Teams provides a new intersection from a large user based of active users.

1.3	Prior art

1.3.1	Encapsulation

David Waller’s user encapsulation effort to encapsulate.

This work would be beneficial to the multiple options below:
•	Complex schema modifications like Horizontal partitioning
•	Moving users tables to a new server is difficult because we for example join directly to group_members.
•	Data cleanup because it would be easier to detect how data is used, and flighting strategies, like creating backup tables partitioning

1.4	User Head Room Analysis

As Microsoft Teams integrates the Storyline feature, a pivotal component of the M365 ecosystem, understanding and planning for user domain scalability becomes paramount. This analysis endeavors to scrutinize our infrastructure's readiness to support a surge from the current 650 million to an ambitious 935 million licensed users. It underscores our approach to bolster infrastructure, ensuring seamless scalability and performance. Namely we are focusing on our write node.

1.4.1	Current State Assessment

Our existing setup manages over 650 million user entries, a mix of active and deleted accounts.





User State	Count	%
Active	256,606,268	39.56% of total
Suspended	14,873,974	2.29% of total
Pending	80,749,772	12.45% of total
Deleted	296,592,941	45.70% of total
Total	648,822,955	100


1.4.2	Teams And Engage Licenses




•	Viva Engage Enabled and Teams Enabled: 935,920,549
•	Current Total Users (active + deleted): 648,822,955
		Teams Enabled
		FALSE	TRUE	TOTAL
Viva Engage Enabled	FALSE		248,803,139	248,803,139
	TRUE	30,231,699	935,920,549	966,152,248

1.4.3.4	(Pending): Scale growth Forecast calculation:



Since we’ve not completed a design on user storyline provisioning, we  don’t have projections on engagement or why we provision etc; I’m assuming everyone who uses Teams will need to be provisioned for the time. We’ll iterate on this. I don’t have much better at the moment.

Don’t want ot over promise

Derivation

Metric	Current	Teams Storyline Release (Assuming we provision everyone in teams)	After 10% Growth	Explanation
Users Table Records	665,115,216	1,431,675,613	1,574,843,174	Initial users plus new users added by Teams Storyline release. The calculation for Teams Storyline Release is based on adding new potential users (derived from licensing data and active user intersection with Teams) to the current user base, and then a 10% growth is applied to this new baseline.
Messages Table Records	1,562,916,598	1,719,208,258	1,891,128,084	The count at Teams Storyline Release is derived from an anticipated proportional increase in messages based on user growth. The calculation assumes an increase in messaging activity in line with the increase in active users.
HDB Server IO Load	825,925.485	1,319,168.185	1,451,085.003	The IO load for the HDB server increases in proportion to the increase in user records and their activities. The value for Teams Storyline Release reflects the additional load from new users and activities, scaled from the current load.
Messages Server IO Load	1,305,478.38	1,377,591.724	1,515,812.854	Similar to the HDB server, the Messages server's IO load is scaled based on the projected increase in message volume that comes with the new users from the Teams Storyline release and their activities.


Using these numbers, we scale our user count and our load 115%, This would be adding 50% more load on HDB.

Derivation

# Current total users
current_total_users = 665115216

# Active users that intersect with Teams
active_users_intersect_teams = 256606268 * 0.66

# Teams and Engage intersected users (Licensed users potentially added)
teams_engage_intersected_users = 935920549

# Calculating the total potential users after Teams Storyline release
# Subtracting only the active users that intersect, not affecting the deleted user count
total_potential_users_storyline_release = current_total_users + (teams_engage_intersected_users - active_users_intersect_teams)

# Calculating percentage increase
percentage_increase_storyline_release = ((total_potential_users_storyline_release - current_total_users) / current_total_users) * 100

current_total_users, total_potential_users_storyline_release, percentage_increase_storyline_release

Result
(665115216, 1431675628.12, 115.2522741443341)



This can be such a drastic change, adding 100% more users that it’s hard without a point of comparison or adding load testing to say how HDB would respond.


1.4.4	HDB Hardware Capacity Analysis

Industry best practices suggest leaving a good reserve of capacity when operating a single point of failure, database. Usually it’s about 50-70%, we are at 20%. Memory is somewhat hard to infer from this but consider the io is with in reason meaning there’s limited paging. (we need to monitor that).



HDB




Metric	Dataset HDB (Standard_E64as_v4)	HDB capacity(max 30days)
CPU (vCPUs)	64	<20%
Memory (GiB)	512	100% (*typical)
Storage (GiB)	….	I would ignore this for now. It’s handled by other work being done but calling that out.
IOPS	Up to 128,000

*we must be confired higher than standard

80,000 IOPS and 1200 MBps	<20 %
Network Bandwidth (Mbps)	Up to 32,000	1000 max

*I believe we are bottlenecked elsewhere (V-lan)

THroughput	250

PREMIUM ssd LRS
2x 8gigs

	50 mbs (max) // calculate iops

This Is 20% which also matches IOPS.

50 mb/s is 30% of max
IOPS = (Throughput in mbps )/ IO in MBPS
T100 = T30 / (.3/100)

Messages Vs HDB

Comparing with messages, HDB runs at a slightly higher load on a 2x powered server. Since user is just less than ½ hdb it makes it a good point of comparison in some respect, for example, for some operations where there are workloads higher on one than another, like inserts, message does point to that not being much more overly costly than updates and we scale there fine with half the resources.

Metric	Database Messages Configuration	Dataset HDB Configuration
CPU max in 30 days	12%	20%
Memory Utilization	100	100
Configuration	Standard_E64as_v4	Standard_E64as_v4
CPU	32 vCPUs	64 vCPUs
Memory	256 GiB	512 GiB
Storage	512 GiB (SSD)	1024 GiB (SSD)
IOPS	Up to 64,000	Up to 128,000
Network Bandwidth	Up to 16,000 Mbps	Up to 32,000 Mbps

1.4.5	Key Findings

Current Infrastructure Capabilities: The existing infrastructure is projected to support up to a 50% increase in operational demand, focusing on the write node server's capabilities.

Because HDB is mixed and our users is only 50% of hdb. Overall though users is 50% of HDB, so 70% user ‘s growth is possible I’d highly recommend targeting 50. But that’s a very big set up and we are uncharted territory as you can see we cannot easily compare to messages. It’s best to move in smaller increments and load test as we go. Since a single data base node may not scale in a perfect linear fashion as you double load.

Network: I’ve seen some evidence that somewhere in our infra we are limited to 1gbs which isn’t the write node that has more.

Load Metrics and Workload Distribution: Presently, peak load metrics hover around 20-25% for a mixed workload database. It's anticipated that as the load increases, the system may experience degradation due to higher contention.

Architectural Readiness: User encapsulation is identified as a crucial step towards enhancing architectural flexibility. It is vital for enabling advanced scaling methods and easing the potential transition out of the Home Database (HDB) if necessary.

Operational Enhancement: There is an immediate need to focus on operational improvements, such as removing redundant indexes and improving stale data management, to alleviate the load on the user table.

Scalability Challenges with Doubling User Base: The infrastructure's readiness to handle a 100% increase in the user base is untested and needs rigorous load testing and incremental planning. I’s uncharted territory. We can monitor for how the system responds, but scale is not a linear progression. It would be easier if we had unit of capacity we could add.

Necessity for Architectural Investments: The analysis underlines the need for strategic architectural investments to accommodate the anticipated user growth, stressing the importance of structural flexibility and the potential need for a multi-stamp solution.

1.4.6	Summary

The headroom analysis for Microsoft Teams' Storyline feature within the M365 ecosystem reveals that the current user domain infrastructure can handle a significant increase in operational load. The analysis was conducted with a focus on the write node, which is crucial for the system's scalability.

The analysis suggests cautious optimism for a substantial operational load increase but recognizes the inherent challenges in scaling a solitary resource like the write replica. Strategic, incremental scale planning and thorough load testing are recommended to ensure system integrity under increased workloads.

In moving forward, the analysis recommends a careful and monitored approach to scaling, emphasizing the need for detailed planning and load testing. Architectural flexibility remains a central theme, with user encapsulation serving as a foundational strategy for future growth. The summary underscores the importance of preparedness for the strategic growth trajectory of the Teams Storyline feature, suggesting that while the current infrastructure may support initial growth, long-term scalability will require significant architectural evolution.



and the chart we just drew. you've got about the percentage of teh wrok that is user. it's about 50% of the load. systems don't scale linearly. we are at 20% load on this single database now and you draw aline based on user's write node increase percentage allowed? say in green.

Here is the visual representation of the HDB capacity utilization and headroom analysis based on the data provided:

The red line represents the current load on HDB which is 20%.
The blue bars indicate the current capacity utilization for various metrics on the HDB server.
The green shaded area shows the recommended reserve capacity range between 50-70%, which is the industry best practice to allow for unexpected spikes and to ensure system reliability.
Note that for the 'Memory (GiB)', the utilization is at the maximum capacity (100%), which means it is fully utilized based on the typical configuration. It is essential to monitor this closely as it might affect the performance if the load increases.
The 'Network Bandwidth' metric shows that the current usage is well within the limits, utilizing around 3.125% of the available bandwidth.
This visualization can help understand how close the system is to the recommended reserve capacity and where there may be a need for upgrades or optimizations to handle future growth. ​​


You

The previous picture was better wtih the redline. I also think this doesn't make sense let me try this you had a bar chart turned the other wayy you probay rememvber the current values were plotted for example 20% for cpu. Now given the preecentage that users is today assume that boost up those values equal to the percentage there of 50% how much can se scale users so you'd put a second line before the red bar saying this is the new level we also want to reserve 1/2 the spare capacity for other things.

Does that make sense you are basically drawing a line using math saying how far you can scale users to fit below thre ed line then elave that same capacity you consumed for the other have to stop before the redline in the rpevious one.

i think that's a really good way to explain the recomendation.

i beleive this was the format. It makes a ton more sense than th last one you rew

1.1	Executive Summary

Microsoft Teams' Storyline feature will be a cornerstone of collaborative experiences within the M365 ecosystem. To support its growth trajectory and the associated scale demand on the user domain, we are initiating a headroom analysis on our user’s domain and considering potential mitigations to scale issue. This is critical to understanding our current infrastructure's capacity to manage the existing 650 million entries—comprising both active and deleted users—and to prepare for an target of integrating up to 935 million licensed users.


1.2	Motivation

•	Scale: Currently handling 650 million entries in the users' table, need to store up to one billion users.
•	Opportunity: There are two ways to capture users. We can sell new licenses, or we can capture existing MAU. Teams provides a new intersection from a large user based of active users.

1.3	Prior art

1.3.1	Encapsulation

David Waller’s user encapsulation effort to encapsulate.

This work would be beneficial to the multiple options below:
•	Complex schema modifications like Horizontal partitioning
•	Moving users tables to a new server is difficult because we for example join directly to group_members.
•	Data cleanup because it would be easier to detect how data is used, and flighting strategies, like creating backup tables partitioning

1.4	User Head Room Analysis

As Microsoft Teams integrates the Storyline feature, a pivotal component of the M365 ecosystem, understanding and planning for user domain scalability becomes paramount. This analysis endeavors to scrutinize our infrastructure's readiness to support a surge from the current 650 million to an ambitious 935 million licensed users. It underscores our approach to bolster infrastructure, ensuring seamless scalability and performance. Namely we are focusing on our write node.

1.4.1	Current State Assessment

Our existing setup manages over 650 million user entries, a mix of active and deleted accounts.

1.4.3.4	(Pending): Scale growth Forecast calculation:



Since we’ve not completed a design on user storyline provisioning, we  don’t have projections on engagement or why we provision etc; I’m assuming everyone who uses Teams will need to be provisioned for the time. We’ll iterate on this. I don’t have much better at the moment.

Don’t want ot over promise

Derivation

Metric	Current	Teams Storyline Release (Assuming we provision everyone in teams)	After 10% Growth	Explanation
Users Table Records	665,115,216	1,431,675,613	1,574,843,174	Initial users plus new users added by Teams Storyline release. The calculation for Teams Storyline Release is based on adding new potential users (derived from licensing data and active user intersection with Teams) to the current user base, and then a 10% growth is applied to this new baseline.
Messages Table Records	1,562,916,598	1,719,208,258	1,891,128,084	The count at Teams Storyline Release is derived from an anticipated proportional increase in messages based on user growth. The calculation assumes an increase in messaging activity in line with the increase in active users.
HDB Server IO Load	825,925.485	1,319,168.185	1,451,085.003	The IO load for the HDB server increases in proportion to the increase in user records and their activities. The value for Teams Storyline Release reflects the additional load from new users and activities, scaled from the current load.
Messages Server IO Load	1,305,478.38	1,377,591.724	1,515,812.854	Similar to the HDB server, the Messages server's IO load is scaled based on the projected increase in message volume that comes with the new users from the Teams Storyline release and their activities.


Using these numbers, we scale our user count and our load 115%, This would be adding 50% more load on HDB.

Derivation

# Current total users
current_total_users = 665115216

# Active users that intersect with Teams
active_users_intersect_teams = 256606268 * 0.66

# Teams and Engage intersected users (Licensed users potentially added)
teams_engage_intersected_users = 935920549

# Calculating the total potential users after Teams Storyline release
# Subtracting only the active users that intersect, not affecting the deleted user count
total_potential_users_storyline_release = current_total_users + (teams_engage_intersected_users - active_users_intersect_teams)

# Calculating percentage increase
percentage_increase_storyline_release = ((total_potential_users_storyline_release - current_total_users) / current_total_users) * 100

current_total_users, total_potential_users_storyline_release, percentage_increase_storyline_release

Result
(665115216, 1431675628.12, 115.2522741443341)



This can be such a drastic change, adding 100% more users that it’s hard without a point of comparison or adding load testing to say how HDB would respond.


1.4.4	HDB Hardware Capacity Analysis

Industry best practices suggest leaving a good reserve of capacity when operating a single point of failure, database. Usually it’s about 50-70%, we are at 20%. Memory is somewhat hard to infer from this but consider the io is with in reason meaning there’s limited paging. (we need to monitor that).



HDB




Metric	Dataset HDB (Standard_E64as_v4)	HDB capacity(max 30days)
CPU (vCPUs)	64	<20%
Memory (GiB)	512	100% (*typical)
Storage (GiB)	….	I would ignore this for now. It’s handled by other work being done but calling that out.
IOPS	Up to 128,000

*we must be confired higher than standard

80,000 IOPS and 1200 MBps	<20 %
Network Bandwidth (Mbps)	Up to 32,000	1000 max

*I believe we are bottlenecked elsewhere (V-lan)

THroughput	250

PREMIUM ssd LRS
2x 8gigs

	50 mbs (max) // calculate iops

This Is 20% which also matches IOPS.

50 mb/s is 30% of max
IOPS = (Throughput in mbps )/ IO in MBPS
T100 = T30 / (.3/100)

Messages Vs HDB

Comparing with messages, HDB runs at a slightly higher load on a 2x powered server. Since user is just less than ½ hdb it makes it a good point of comparison in some respect, for example, for some operations where there are workloads higher on one than another, like inserts, message does point to that not being much more overly costly than updates and we scale there fine with half the resources.

Metric	Database Messages Configuration	Dataset HDB Configuration
CPU max in 30 days	12%	20%
Memory Utilization	100	100
Configuration	Standard_E64as_v4	Standard_E64as_v4
CPU	32 vCPUs	64 vCPUs
Memory	256 GiB	512 GiB
Storage	512 GiB (SSD)	1024 GiB (SSD)
IOPS	Up to 64,000	Up to 128,000
Network Bandwidth	Up to 16,000 Mbps	Up to 32,000 Mbps


Storage Footprint Summary

Cluster/Table	Size (TB)

1.4.5	Key Findings

Current Infrastructure Capabilities: The existing infrastructure is projected to support up to a 50% increase in operational demand, focusing on the write node server's capabilities.

Here is the theoretical max increase:



Because HDB is mixed and our users is only 50% of hdb. Overall though users is 50% of HDB, so 70% user ‘s growth is possible I’d highly recommend targeting 50. But that’s a very big set up and we are uncharted territory as you can see we cannot easily compare to messages. It’s best to move in smaller increments and load test as we go. Since a single data base node may not scale in a perfect linear fashion as you double load.

Network: I’ve seen some evidence that somewhere in our infra we are limited to 1gbs which isn’t the write node that has more.

Load Metrics and Workload Distribution: Presently, peak load metrics hover around 20-25% for a mixed workload database. It's anticipated that as the load increases, the system may experience degradation due to higher contention.

Architectural Readiness: User encapsulation is identified as a crucial step towards enhancing architectural flexibility. It is vital for enabling advanced scaling methods and easing the potential transition out of the Home Database (HDB) if necessary.

Operational Enhancement: There is an immediate need to focus on operational improvements, such as removing redundant indexes and improving stale data management, to alleviate the load on the user table.

Scalability Challenges with Doubling User Base: The infrastructure's readiness to handle a 100% increase in the user base is untested and needs rigorous load testing and incremental planning. I’s uncharted territory. We can monitor for how the system responds, but scale is not a linear progression. It would be easier if we had unit of capacity we could add.

Necessity for Architectural Investments: The analysis underlines the need for strategic architectural investments to accommodate the anticipated user growth, stressing the importance of structural flexibility and the potential need for a multi-stamp solution.

1.4.6	Summary

The headroom analysis for Microsoft Teams' Storyline feature within the M365 ecosystem reveals that the current user domain infrastructure can handle a significant increase in operational load. The analysis was conducted with a focus on the write node, which is crucial for the system's scalability.

The analysis suggests cautious optimism for a substantial operational load increase but recognizes the inherent challenges in scaling a solitary resource like the write replica. Strategic, incremental scale planning and thorough load testing are recommended to ensure system integrity under increased workloads.

In moving forward, the analysis recommends a careful and monitored approach to scaling, emphasizing the need for detailed planning and load testing. Architectural flexibility remains a central theme, with user encapsulation serving as a foundational strategy for future growth. The summary underscores the importance of preparedness for the strategic growth trajectory of the Teams Storyline feature, suggesting that while the current infrastructure may support initial growth, long-term scalability will require significant architectural evolution.

The visualization has been adjusted to include the current utilization levels for various metrics (CPU, Memory, IOPS, Network Bandwidth, Throughput), represented by the blue bars. The additional capacity that could be allocated to users is indicated by the green extension on these bars. The red line represents the recommended maximum capacity limit, set at 70%, to ensure there's headroom for unexpected spikes and to maintain system reliability.

From this visualization, you can see that if we were to scale user load by an additional 50% of the HDB load, we could allocate an additional 17.5% of the server capacity to users (half of the available headroom between the current load and the red line). This is visualized by the green bars, which extend the current utilization proportionally based on the users' current load impact.

This graphical representation can aid in understanding how much more load can be added while staying within the best practices limit for reserve capacity. It's a tool to communicate the recommendation of how far users can be scaled before reaching the critical limit, leaving an equal amount of reserve capacity for other operations and unexpected demands. ​​

This plot illustrates the current utilization of various HDB resources and the projected additional utilization for users, capped by the recommended reserve capacity. The reserve capacity is marked with a red dashed line at 70% utilization for each metric, which is the industry-advised threshold to ensure headroom for unforeseen spikes in demand. ​​

Let's see if ic an spell this better:

this covers the good pictuer where we want to just add a new line for users capacity incrase which is 50% of hdb. I want to only go up to a max of 55% over and we are mostly at 20%. as documented. So that means about 1/2 * 55-20 (20 being the current load) is how much we are increasing those bars. Just add soem color to the end extending the bars for those percentage please

# Let's modify the previous plot to include a red line at 70% to indicate the upper limit of recommended usage.

but use this ^^ . can't you jsut make the lines longer. The amount to do so asi said is to just take 50% the percent that is users, scale it by some percentage that only adds about 17% load.
but the axises and such shouldn't be chasnging from what i gave you. You are doing all kinds of weird stuff on these new ones such as going to 1000% utilization ti doesn't make a lto off sense.

You
one mistake don't do it for memory. Now here is what it hink.

if we take the cpu do the rest for the other other than memory

cpu was 20%

let's say that we have a line blue before red line where we say scale capacity for users so that's goign to be 50% of the reserve capacity.

that would be 55 (i think 70 is agressive)  so mvoe red to 55

then

55-20/2 // the reason is user only gets half. For each of these metrics i want to boost from the bule to the green (new capacity allowed) for user. then at the end of the fatherst green line i want to draw a line for excess scale capacity for users.

The orange line indicates the excess scale capacity for users after the green bars, ensuring that there is a reserve for other system needs. This visualization aids in understanding how much additional load can be supported by the system while maintaining a reserve for unpredicted spikes or additional requirements. ​​


You
So close!

we cannot cross the yellow for one so you understand. that's 55% was teh scale limit for the server as defiend by best practices. I want to divide for each of these metrics giving haflf of the good spare to users for my forecast so again for example

cpu should be blue from 0-20, then green from (55-20)/2 doing that for all the metrics with their corresoidning blue values. The ultimate scale line i want to move back to 55% that's the limit we want to allow. we want to give users half this.  Actually it's pretty easy becvuase throughput cpu and ips were all around 20. So they are actually  all kind of similar number here. You keep getting the green wrong becuase i'm asking you to not only draw that but also move the yellow line you have now that's at 75% or whatever put that at 55% then, and then based on that we are claculating the green as defined

You
ok let's make the yellow line red (because that is the server limit). now sicne users is 50% of the loadon hdb i think we make a line at the green and say this allows us to scale by about 50% leaving some buffer. we can spell out that that is because even though tis' half 37*2 is more like 70, we know things don' really scale linearly. finally you can remove the network bandwith, it's not that valuable here probably. thanks! almost htere!!!

fix this message i think ti's sufficient.

Assuming we allow a 50% increase. Method:
Assign half the spare load from our desired limit to users, and multiply by 2 (75) then take 25 because things don’t’ always scale linearly

The lines at 50%, 55%, and 75% are marked with annotations for 'Lower Bound Best Practices', 'Comfortable', and 'Scary', respectively.
The 'Scary' threshold (75%) is intentionally high to signal a limit that should not be reached for safety.
The 'Comfortable' threshold (55%) is set as the target maximum utilization after the user load increase.
The 'Lower Bound Best Practices' threshold (50%) marks a conservative limit for capacity planning. ​​

Here is the updated visualization with the text for the threshold labels adjusted so they don't overlap each other. The red line is set at 70% to indicate the server limit, and the green extension on the bars represents the additional capacity allocated for user load increase. The labels for the thresholds are now placed at different heights to ensure clear readability. ​​

ax.annotate('Scary (75%)', xy=(75, 0), xytext=(76, -0.5),
            arrowprops=dict(facecolor='red', shrink=0.05), color='red')

can they be offest on y ?

I've adjusted the annotations to avoid overlap by offsetting them on the y-axis. This visual representation clearly marks the "Lower Bound Best Practices" at 50%, a "Comfortable" threshold at 55%, and a "Scary" level at 75%, providing a clear guideline for capacity planning and utilization levels. ​​

does thsi wording make snees?


•	We've set a desired server utilization limit at 55%, to maintain a reserve of capacity in line with best practices.
•	We aim to allocate half of the spare capacity up to this limit specifically for user growth. Given that the current load is around 20%(max), this gives us an additional 17.5% (which is half the difference between 55% and 20%) to allocate to users.
•	Because users currently account for 50% of the load (current users is only using about 10%), it seems like if we get it more than that by 17% we can assume about 50% capacity increase is doeable and staying with in industry best practifces.
